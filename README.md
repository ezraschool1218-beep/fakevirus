This project is a harmless prank popup made with Python (Tkinter).

It does not:

Access or modify files

Connect to the internet

Install anything

Collect data

Some antivirus tools may flag the compiled .exe as suspicious because it was built using PyInstaller (--onefile), which packs the program into a single executable. This packaging method can trigger false positives.

All source code is included in this repository. You can review or build it yourself.
